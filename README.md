### Background:
The goal of our Milestone 2 Project is twofold: 1) predict national park visitation through supervised learning techniques and 2) cluster parks based on ecosystem similarity using a K-means clustering algorithm. Included in this repository are the datasets and notebooks used to conduct the analyses described in our final report.
